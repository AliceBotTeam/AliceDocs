# Getting Started

## Inviting the bot to your Discord server

* Alice™ is available in Discord and it can be added to your servers.
* This link will add the Alice™ to your server
* Give the necessary permissions and you're done inviting it to your server

{% hint style="info" %}
The bot will ask for "`Administrator`" permission in order to setup the chatbot channel for you.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Setting up the bot

* Run the command "`/chatbot enable`" in Your server
* You can either choose an existing channel (for setup) or the bot will automatically set it up for you
* Then chat in the chat to check Alice is replying
* Use `,` at the very beginning of your messages to make the bot ignore that specific message to respond

{% hint style="info" %}
If Alice tells you that there's already a bot channel then run the following command

`/chatbot reset`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Voting _(for the bot)_ is required ONLY to setup the channel. (Not for chatting)
