# FAQ, Alice

#### Do I have to vote everytime to talk with Alice?

> No, you have to vote ONLY TO SETUP THE CHATBOT CHANNEL, not to talk with Alice&#x20;
>
> This means that we can talk with her by pinging her at any channels, WITHOUT HAVING TO VOTE.

#### Alice is responding weird to me (or) Alice behaves in the way it not supposed to be. What to do?

> It is natural for Alice to go odd at sometimes as Alice is keeping what you said in her memory.
>
> Fortunately, anyone can trigger the command `/reset` so that Alice will come to state where she was in the beginning&#x20;
>
> i.e, The command `/reset` will fix Alice's odd behaviour

#### Alice is not responding in my server. Alice is returning "Interaction Failed" message. What to do !?

> First of all, we thank you for using Alice in your server and in the meantime we have to say you that we are not a huge company running this bot. :(
>
> You mostly be facing this problem because of latency issues (Alice's speed to response is very slow)
>
> This latency issue causes Alice very slow (or impossible)  to respond to messages, commands (that says "interaction failed").
>
> We are constantly working on fixing this issue.
>
> Please be patient and we are sorry for the inconvenience.&#x20;
